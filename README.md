# Neon Index

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.23. (Migrated to Angular 10)

## Getting Started
Start by cloning the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/DDMAL/neon-index.git
cd neon-index
```

Install npm

```
npm install
```

Install Angular CLI:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
(or `sudo npm install -g @angular/cli` for MacOS/Linux users)


Run `ng v` to verify that Angular CLI is working properly. 

Versions information should display, verify that these match:
```
Angular CLI: 13.3.5
Node: >=10.
npm: >=8.
Angular: 10.0.9
```

If problems arise:
```
npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
npm cache verify
npm install -g @angular/cli@x.x.x
```
Where `x.x.x.` is the version number. 

If you need to change versions of Node or npm, use NVM ([Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).
